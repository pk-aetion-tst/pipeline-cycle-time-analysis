"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.

"When webapp starts up, it'll send a request to /api/v1/patient-datasets/latest-datasets?instanceId={instanceId}
to get a list of all the currently installed datasets in that instance. This only returns datasets that are active
and associated with that instance id in the patient_dataset_instances table.

For each patient dataset in that list, it'll have an associated entry in the datasets table with the guid
being mapped to the patient_dataset's schema_guid if that dataset is the active revision in that instance.
For each patient dataset without an entry in that table matching the schema_guid, this means that the dataset
is technically installed in that instance, but it is not active.

If there are any issues with webapp starting up and being able to parse a dataset's information, then
webapp skips the dataset, logs the error, and moves on to the next dataset. The result is the datasets
being loaded into the schema cache on startup. Subsequent calls to the schema controller will use the
schema cache.

The exception to datasets that are in scope for this check are deprecated datasets. They will appear
to be installed to the instance still from schema-service, but due to their files no longer existing in the
runtime directory, these datasets will not be loaded into the schema cache when webapp starts up.

In order to detect if the dataset has been loaded correctly, this test will attempt to fetch the dataset's
DatasetInfoPair using the dataset id and the dataset_instance id. If the dataset is not loaded properly by
webapp, then the schema cache won't return anything and we will see an internal error thrown.

If this test fails, check webapp's startup logs. There will most likely be an exception thrown when
attempting to add a dataset to the schema cache loader.
